# DeDRM_tools
DeDRM tools for ebooks

This build is modified to void out the val406 provision, otherwise known
as the bit that makes decrypting rented books not work.

This fork was created in order to support those using accessibility software
that does not work well with software that natively supports the tools that
can read encrypted ebooks.

This tool is not intended to promote piracy, and I actively discourage users
from using DeDRM for the purposes of Piracy.
